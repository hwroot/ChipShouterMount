# ChipShouterMount
Mount for ChipShouter

UNTESTED and UNFINISHED never had a change to finish this thing.

I originally was planning on using it with Open Builds MiniMill dimentions should fit ChipShouter extruded enclosure made by Hammond.

Cut out in front should provide easy way to snap in ChipShouter in place ( undtested ) and then using self-tapping screws on the sides to secure it in place.
